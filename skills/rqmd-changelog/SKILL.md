  guide:
    summary: Curate CHANGELOG.md as a concise release narrative led by user-visible outcomes and human decisions.
    workflow:
      - Start from the shipped behavior, requirement updates, and recent user-directed changes.
      - Write the primary changelog bullets for end-user impact, release-relevant decisions, and notable workflow shifts.
      - Keep supporting AI implementation detail subordinate under a nested heading such as `AI Development` when it adds useful context.
    examples:
      - rqmd --verify-summaries --non-interactive
      - rqmd-ai --json --dump-status proposed
      - rqmd-ai --json --workflow-mode implement

Use this skill when changelog quality matters as its own task, not just as a side effect of general docs sync.

Workflow:
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased` before cutting a new version when the work has not shipped yet.
- Lead with human-directed decisions, user-visible behavior changes, and other release-relevant outcomes.
- When a bullet mainly records that a tracked requirement shipped, prefer wording like `Implemented RQMD-UNDO-008: size, retention, and compaction policy for persisted history` instead of `Updated requirement status to mark RQMD-UNDO-008 as Implemented ...`.
- Keep low-signal implementation detail out of the primary bullets; if the detail matters, group it under a nested `AI Development` heading instead of mixing it into the main narrative.
- Prefer concise bullets that a human reviewer can scan quickly during release prep.
- Structure changelog entries with the same rich formatting from `/rqmd-docs`:
  - **Nest bullet lists** under top-level entries when a feature has multiple sub-points, shipped components, or grouped details — avoid long flat lists that bury context.
  - Use the **Subject:** pattern (`- **Subject:** description`) for entries that benefit from a scannable bold lead.
  - Use subheadings (e.g., `#### Telemetry`, `#### Performance`) to group related entries when a release is large enough that a flat `### Added` list becomes hard to navigate.
  - Use **strong**, *emphasis*, and emoji consistently to match the project’s documentation voice (see `/rqmd-docs` for the full style guide).
- Keep the changelog aligned with the affected requirement docs, README guidance, and bundle workflow text when those surfaces changed too.

Constraints:
- Preserve Keep a Changelog structure.
- Do not turn the changelog into a commit log or exhaustive implementation diary.
- Include AI-enabling work only when it materially explains the shipped outcome or future maintenance path.
- Skills improve workflow discovery; shell and tool approvals may still be required.

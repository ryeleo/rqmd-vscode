description: Improve repository documentation quality using authored standards for readability, structure, jargon handling, and page organization. Use when docs need more than simple drift correction.
argument-hint: Describe which documentation pages need improvement and whether the work is about structure, clarity, jargon, callouts, or splitting long pages.

    summary: Improve documentation quality as a first-class workflow, not just a sync pass.
    workflow:
      - Start from the active documentation standards and the audience for the page.
      - Improve headings, page structure, hyperlinks, jargon explanations, and list formatting so the doc is faster to scan and easier to trust.
      - Split oversized pages into smaller linked pages or index pages when that meaningfully improves navigation.
    examples:
      - rqmd --verify-summaries --non-interactive
      - rqmd-ai --json --dump-id RQMD-AI-040 --include-requirement-body
      - rqmd-ai --json --dump-status proposed

Use this skill when the documentation itself needs better writing, structure, or organization rather than only post-change alignment.

Workflow:
- Use headings consistently: start at h1 and do not skip heading levels.
- Prefer many smaller pages over one oversized page; create brief index pages when splitting large content improves navigation.
- Introduce acronyms and jargon on first use, and add Info-style callouts when readers may need extra context.
- Prefer descriptive hyperlinks over raw pasted URLs or direct references to other 'docs' files in the repo.
- Use ordered or unordered lists to break up dense prose when they improve scanning.
  - **Nest bullet lists** when items have sub-detail, sub-steps, or grouped facets — flat lists that could benefit from hierarchy should be restructured into nested lists.
  - Use the **Subject:** pattern (`- **Subject:** description or detail`) to call out key items within a list so readers can scan the bold lead and skip the detail if they already know it.
- When a topic needs enough emphasis that a bold lead is not sufficient, promote it to a subheading instead — subheadings improve navigation for *all* readers (screen readers, table-of-contents generators, quick scrollers), not just those who notice bold text.
- Use **strong** text to highlight key terms, names, or outcomes; use *emphasis* for nuance, caveats, or softer callouts; use ***strong emphasis*** sparingly for truly critical points.
- Use emoji consistently to convey meaning at a glance (e.g., lifecycle labels like 💡 Proposed / 🔧 Implemented, callout icons like ℹ️ / ⚠️ / 🚨). Emoji should add signal, not decoration — pick a small consistent set and reuse it rather than scattering random emoji.
- Use Info, Note, and Warning callouts deliberately to separate optional context, important reminders, and critical warnings.
- Keep documentation technical but user-friendly, written like a web article worth reading rather than a dump of internal notes.
- Never include secrets in documentation or code examples.

Callout examples:

> **ℹ️ Info:** `rqmd --verify-summaries --non-interactive` only verifies summary blocks and does not rewrite requirement files.

> **⚠️ Note:** If a page introduces `rqmd-ai` before `rqmd`, expand the acronym on first use and explain the relationship once rather than assuming prior context.

> **🚨 Warning:** Do not paste tokens, credentials, or internal-only URLs into repository documentation, even in examples.

Use that exact callout shape when you need one; avoid mixing in all-caps or multiple icon variants unless a repository already standardized on them.

Constraints:
- Do not use this skill when the real task is only keeping docs aligned with a known behavior change; use `/rqmd-doc-sync` for that.
- Keep requirement docs, README guidance, and bundle text consistent with shipped behavior when you improve them.
- Prefer focused improvements over needless rewrites, but do restructure or split pages when readability is clearly suffering.
- Skills improve workflow discovery; shell and tool approvals may still be required.

## When to add diagrams

Diagrams are valuable when *prose alone* would leave readers confused about:
- **State machines:** mode transitions, boolean flag lifecycles, requirement status flows.
- **Call graphs / execution paths:** which functions call which, how data flows through a pipeline, save/restore sequences.
- **Decision trees:** branching logic that prose would over-explain.

When a topic is tricky enough to warrant a diagram, add it *inline* in the most applicable markdown file using a fenced `mermaid` code block. Inline diagrams:
- Live with the text they explain — single source of truth.
- Render natively in VS Code preview, GitHub, and most modern markdown viewers.
- Require no build step or generated assets to track in git.

Use `/rqmd-diagram` to author and validate the diagram. Run `mmdc -i <file.md>` as a linter to catch syntax errors before committing.

> **ℹ️ Info:** Prefer inline Mermaid over external `.mmd` files. External files require a build step, generate assets that clutter the repo, and divorce the diagram from its context.

    summary: Turn loose planning notes into ranked requirement proposals before implementation starts.
    workflow:
      - Start from raw planning notes such as docs/brainstorm.md or targeted requirement exports.
      - Promote brainstorm items into tracked requirement proposals with target docs, IDs, statuses, and priorities.
      - Keep the output read-only so requirement changes can be reviewed before any implementation work begins.
    examples:
      - rqmd-ai --json --workflow-mode brainstorm
      - rqmd-ai --json --dump-file ai-cli.md --include-domain-markdown
      - rqmd-ai --json --dump-status proposed

Use when work starts as notes instead of tracked requirements.

## Workflow

1. Export planning guidance: `rqmd-ai --json --workflow-mode brainstorm`
2. Read `docs/brainstorm.md` and cross-check `rqmd-ai --json --dump-status proposed`
3. Convert viable ideas into tracked proposals:
   - Target requirement doc, suggested ID, `💡 Proposed` status, priority from project catalog
   - **Use `next_id` from JSON output** — never calculate IDs manually
4. **Bug detection:** If an item describes broken behavior or regression, use `- **Type:** bug` and `- **Affects:** <ID>` metadata with Steps/Expected/Actual/Root Cause template
5. Update requirement docs, index, and `CHANGELOG.md` before code

## Constraints

- Do not skip tracking for net-new behavior
- Keep output read-only until reviewed

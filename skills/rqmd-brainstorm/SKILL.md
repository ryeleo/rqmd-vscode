    summary: Turn loose planning notes into ranked requirement proposals before implementation starts.
    workflow:
      - Start from raw planning notes such as docs/brainstorm.md or targeted requirement exports.
      - Promote brainstorm items into tracked requirement proposals with target docs, IDs, statuses, and priorities.
      - Keep the output read-only so requirement changes can be reviewed before any implementation work begins.
    examples:
      - rqmd-ai --json --workflow-mode brainstorm
      - rqmd-ai --json --dump-file ai-cli.md --include-domain-markdown
      - rqmd-ai --json --dump-status proposed

Use this skill when the work starts as notes instead of tracked requirements.

Workflow:
- Export planning guidance with `rqmd-ai --json --workflow-mode brainstorm`.
- Read the brainstorm source, usually `docs/brainstorm.md`.
- Cross-check existing backlog with `rqmd-ai --json --dump-status proposed`.
- Convert viable ideas into tracked proposals with target requirement docs, suggested IDs, canonical `💡 Proposed` status, and priorities that follow the active project priority catalog.
- **Use `next_id` from the `rqmd-ai --json` output to allocate new requirement IDs.** Each domain file includes a `next_id` field (e.g., `"next_id": "RQMD-CORE-044"`) that tells you the next safe ID to use. ***Never*** calculate the next ID manually by grepping or counting — always read it from the JSON output to avoid duplicate ID collisions.
- When a brainstorm item describes a defect — broken behavior, a regression, something that "used to work," or a Steps to Reproduce pattern — treat it as a bug report. Use `- **Type:** bug` and `- **Affects:** <ID>` metadata, and prefer the Steps to Reproduce / Expected / Actual / Root Cause template instead of the user-story + Given/When/Then shape.
- Update requirement docs, the requirements index, and `CHANGELOG.md` before code when the proposal changes shipped behavior or workflow.

Constraints:
- Do not skip requirement tracking and jump straight to code for net-new behavior.
- Keep the output read-only until requirement/doc changes are reviewed.
- Skills improve workflow discovery; shell and tool approvals may still be required.
